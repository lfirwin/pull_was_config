# This file holds the properties used by gather_ree.sh and gather_ree_ssh.sh
# scripts.  Any variable that is changeable should be put into this file.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Adhoc variables used by the script
# ==================================
# Temp folder
tmp="/tmp"

# Name of index files 
tmp_index=${tmp}/html/config-index.html
xml_index=config-index-xml.html
index=config-index.html

# Web site home directory
home=/service/config-data/wpp-ree

# Directory of scripts on WAS DMGR
local_scripts="/apps/scripts/ree"

# Log file variables
log=${tmp}/gather_ree.log
log_html=${home}/log.html

# Environments array
#   Each element of the array is comprised of these parts separated by a "|"
#      environment name - used for naming the associated html file
#      title - title to use in the html file
#      host - fqdn of the host
#      port - the ssl port for the WAS console
#      bin - location of the bin directory from which to run the wsadmin.sh command
#
# These entries are grouped by host so that they show up on the home page grouped accordingly.
# When adding an entry, add it under the last entry of the host.  If this is a new host, simply
# add to the end of the array.
#
# NOTE: You only need to add the DMGR unless the environment uses WAS Base (where there is no DMGR).
